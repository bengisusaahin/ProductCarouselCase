This project replicates the "Recommended for You" product carousel from the e-bebek.com homepage. It is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without relying on third-party libraries such as jQuery.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML DOM API
- CSS (inline injection)
- localStorage
- Fetch API

## Development Decisions
## Responsiveness
The structure mimics the real DOM on e-bebek.com. Extra effort was put into mimicking layout behaviors and ensuring mobile compatibility using scroll width, margins, and breakpoints.

## Favorites Toggle
The heart icon uses four different SVG states and toggles via class switching. The favorite product IDs are stored in localStorage under the key ebFavorites.

## Scroll Logic
Carousel scroll is handled by translating the X position of the .owl-stage with JavaScript. Button states and scroll bounds are dynamically calculated using container width and item width.

## Semantic Commits
This project follows atomic commit practices and uses semantic commit messages. 

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. This makes it easier to understand the history of changes and to revert specific changes if necessary.
  
- **Semantic Commit Messages**: Commit messages should follow the format:
  - `type(scope): subject`
  - Examples of types include:
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation changes
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

This practice helps maintain a clear and organized commit history, making it easier for contributors to understand the project's evolution.
